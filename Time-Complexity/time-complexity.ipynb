    "Here's a step-by-step explanation of the code:\n",

    "\n",
    "3. **Generating the Fibonacci Series:**\n",
    "   - The `fibonacci_series` function creates a list of the first `n` Fibonacci numbers. It does this by iterating over a range from 0 to `n-1` and applying the `fibonacci` function to each index.\n",

    "5. **Executing the Function:**\n",
    "   - When `fibonacci_series(6)` is called, the `fibonacci` function is invoked six times (for indices 0 through 5), and the resulting Fibonacci numbers are collected into a list.\n",
    "\n",

    "This Python code defines a recursive function to determine if a given string can be segmented into a sequence of dictionary words, without reordering. It checks if the entire string can be broken down into valid words as specified by a list of allowed words (dictionary).\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a step-by-step explanation of the code:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialization of the Recursive Function:**\n",
    "   - A helper recursive function named `can_break` is defined within the main function. This function takes the string, a set of dictionary words, and a starting index as its parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Base Case for Recursion:**\n",
    "   - The recursive function checks if the current start index has reached the end of the string. If so, it returns `True`, indicating that the string from the beginning up to this point can be completely segmented using the dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Iteration Over Possible Endings:**\n",
    "   - The function iterates over possible end positions for a word starting from the start index. This loop checks every possible substring starting from the index `start` to the end of the string.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Substring Check:**\n",
    "   - Within the loop, the function checks if the substring from the start index to the current end index exists in the dictionary set.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Recursive Call:**\n",
    "   - If a valid dictionary word is found, the function makes a recursive call with the new start position set to the current end index. This checks if the remaining part of the string (from end to the end of the string) can also be segmented into dictionary words.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Result of the Recursive Call:**\n",
    "   - If the recursive call returns `True`, it means that from the current start position, the string can be broken down successfully. Hence, the function returns `True`.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Completion of Loop:**\n",
    "   - If no valid segment is found that leads to a successful segmentation for the current starting position, the loop completes, and the function returns `False`, indicating the string cannot be segmented starting from this start index.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Conversion to Set for Efficiency:**\n",
    "   - Before the recursive function is invoked, the list of dictionary words is converted to a set for faster lookup times. This is crucial because checking membership in a set is typically faster than in a list.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **Final Output:**\n",
    "   - The main function returns whatever result is produced by the helper recursive function, which is then printed to show whether the string can be segmented or not.\n"

    "This Python code implements a solution for the N-Queens problem using recursion. It attempts to place N queens on an N×N chessboard such that no two queens threaten each other. The solution involves recursively placing queens on the board while ensuring that each placement is safe, meaning no two queens can attack each other either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a step-by-step explanation of the code:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialization of the Chessboard:**\n",
    "   - The chessboard is represented as a list of lists filled with `.` indicating empty spaces. Each list represents a row on the chessboard.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Recursive Function `solve`:**\n",
    "   - This function attempts to place queens column by column. It accepts the current state of the board and the column index where the next queen should be placed.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Base Case of Recursion:**\n",
    "   - The base case checks if the column index is equal to N, indicating that a queen has been successfully placed in each column. If this condition is met, a valid arrangement of the board is converted into a list of strings and added to the results list.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Iteration Over Rows:**\n",
    "   - For each column, the function iterates over all rows to find a safe row to place a queen.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Safety Check Using `is_safe`:**\n",
    "   - Before placing a queen, the `is_safe` function is called to check if placing a queen at the current row and column is safe. This function checks three conditions:\n",
    "     1. No other queen is placed in the same row on the left side.\n",
    "     2. No other queen is placed on the upper diagonal.\n",
    "     3. No other queen is placed on the lower diagonal.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Placing a Queen:**\n",
    "   - If a row is found safe, the queen (`Q`) is placed on the board at that row and column. The recursive function `solve` is then called with the next column index.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Backtracking:**\n",
    "   - After the recursive call returns, the placed queen is removed (replaced with `.`) to explore other possibilities. This step is crucial for backtracking and finding all possible solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Collecting and Returning Results:**\n",
    "   - All valid board configurations are collected in a list named `results`. Each board configuration is stored as a list of strings, where each string represents a row of the chessboard.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **Output of Results:**\n",
    "   - After all possible configurations have been explored, the list of results is returned and can be printed to show all possible ways to solve the N-Queens problem for a board of size N.\n"
