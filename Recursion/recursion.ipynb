    "   - For a stack of disks greater than one, the Tower of Hanoi algorithm breaks down the problem into three subproblems.\n",

    "This Python code uses dynamic programming to build a table (`dp`) that represents the minimum number of operations required to convert substrings of `word1` to substrings of `word2`. The final result is the value stored in `dp[m][n]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step-by-Step Explanation of the Code:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialization:**\n",
    "   - The code starts by initializing two variables, `m` and `n`, representing the lengths of `word1` and `word2`, respectively.\n",
    "   - It also creates a 2D list `dp` to store the minimum number of operations for converting substrings of `word1` to substrings of `word2`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Base Cases:**\n",
    "   - The code initializes the first row and first column of the `dp` table to represent the minimum number of operations required to convert an empty string to a string of length `i` or `j`.\n",
    "   - For example, `dp[i][0]` represents the minimum operations to convert an empty string to a string of length `i`, which is simply inserting `i` characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Dynamic Programming Iteration:**\n",
    "   - The code then uses a nested loop to iterate over each character of both words.\n",
    "   - For each pair of characters at positions `i` and `j`, it updates the `dp` table based on the three possible operations: insertion, deletion, or replacement.\n",
    "     - If the characters are equal, no operation is needed (`dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1]`).\n",
    "     - If the characters are not equal, it takes the minimum of three cases: insertion (`dp[i][j-1]`), deletion (`dp[i-1][j]`), or replacement (`dp[i-1][j-1]`).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Final Result:**\n",
    "   - After completing the dynamic programming table, the final result is stored in `dp[m][n]`, representing the minimum operations to convert the entire `word1` to `word2`.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Example Usage:**\n",
    "   - The code is then called with two example word pairs: `\"horse\"` and `\"ros\"`, and `\"intention\"` and `\"execution\"`.\n",
    "   - The results are printed, showing the minimum number of operations required for each pair.\n"
